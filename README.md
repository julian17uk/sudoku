# Sudoku

This is a simple implementation of a Sudoku solver.  

## Getting Started  

Clone this repo and try building the software in terminal with  

$g++ main.cpp

or  

$c++ main.cpp

To run the solver enter  

$./a.out  

## Prerequisites

A basic c++ compiler e.g. g++ on MacOS

The initial sudoku grid is held in main.cpp. See int grid[N][N] = ...

The grid can be changed here and then the code re-built (this is simpler that entering all the grid values in
 the terminal.
